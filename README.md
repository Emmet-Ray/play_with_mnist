This repository contains program files I wrote to play with MNIST based on [the source code](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

To know how to train the model or to learn more, see [the book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)

To know how to run this code to play with your own handwritten number, see the bottom of [this file][guess_from_picture.py)
